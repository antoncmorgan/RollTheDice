To make the ground have physics but not move, you can add a line of code that creates a physics impostor for the ground mesh. For example, you could add the following line after the line that creates the ground mesh:

```js
ground.physicsImpostor = new BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor(ground, BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor.BoxImpostor, {mass: 0, friction: 0.5, restitution: 0.7}, scene);
```

This line creates a physics impostor for the ground mesh using the `BoxImpostor` type, with a mass of 0 (so it won't move), and the specified values for friction and restitution. This will enable physics for the ground mesh, but since it has a mass of 0, it will not move when the dice are dropped on it.

after apply an impulse how would I check to see if an mesh stopped moving

## ChatGPT
To check if a mesh has stopped moving after applying an impulse, you can use the `getLinearVelocity` method of the physics impostor that is associated with the mesh. This method returns a `BABYLON.Vector3` object that represents the current linear velocity of the mesh, which is the speed and direction in which it is moving.

Here is an example of how you might use this method to check if a mesh has stopped moving:

```js
// Apply an impulse to the mesh
die6.physicsImpostor.applyImpulse(new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 10, 0), die6.getAbsolutePosition());

// Check if the mesh has stopped moving
if (die6.physicsImpostor.getLinearVelocity().length() < 0.1) {
  console.log("The die has stopped moving.");
}
```

In this example, the `applyImpulse` method is used to apply a vertical impulse to the die, which will make it start moving upwards. The `getLinearVelocity` method is then called to check the current linear velocity of the die. If the length of this vector is less than 0.1, it means that the die has stopped moving, and a message is logged to the console.

You could also use the `getAngularVelocity` method to check the current angular velocity of the mesh, which is the speed and direction in which it is rotating. You could use this method in a similar way to check if the mesh has stopped rotating.

how would I check this in a loop, would I use the renderloop

## ChatGPT
To check if a mesh has stopped moving in a loop, you can use the `BABYLON.Scene.registerBeforeRender` method to register a callback function that will be called on each iteration of the render loop. In this callback function, you can use the `getLinearVelocity` method of the physics impostor to check if the mesh has stopped moving, and take any necessary action.

Here is an example of how you might use the `registerBeforeRender` method to check if a mesh has stopped moving in a loop:

```js
// Register a callback function to be called on each iteration of the render loop
scene.registerBeforeRender(function () {
  // Check if the mesh has stopped moving
  if (die6.physicsImpostor.getLinearVelocity().length() < 0.1) {
    console.log("The die has stopped moving.");
  }
});
```

In this example, the `registerBeforeRender` method is used to register a callback function that will be called on each iteration of the render loop. In this callback function, the `getLinearVelocity` method is used to check if the die has stopped moving, and a message is logged to the console if it has.

You could also use the `getAngularVelocity` method to check the current angular velocity of the mesh, and take any necessary action if the mesh has stopped rotating.

Note that the `registerBeforeRender` method is called on the `BABYLON.Scene` object, so you will need to have a reference to the scene in order to use it. In the code you provided, the `scene` variable is created as a `BABYLON.Scene` object, so you can use that variable to register the callback function.

how can I reset the impuls

## ChatGPT
To reset the impulse that has been applied to a mesh, you can use the `resetForces` method of the physics impostor that is associated with the mesh. This method will reset all of the forces that have been applied to the mesh, including any impulses, so that it is no longer moving or rotating.

Here is an example of how you might use the `resetForces` method to reset the impulse applied to a mesh:

```js
// Apply an impulse to the mesh
die6.physicsImpostor.applyImpulse(new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 10, 0), die6.getAbsolutePosition());

// Wait for some time
setTimeout(function () {
  // Reset the impulse on the mesh
  die6.physicsImpostor.resetForces();
}, 1000);
```

In this example, the `applyImpulse` method is used to apply a vertical impulse to the die, which will make it start moving upwards. Then, the `setTimeout` function is used to wait for one second before calling the `resetForces` method on the die's physics impostor. This will reset all of the forces applied to the die, including the impulse, so that it is no longer moving.

## amorganPD

that doesnt seem to exist would there be another way

## ChatGPT
The `resetForces` method is a part of the Babylon.js physics engine, and it is available on the physics impostor objects that are associated with mesh objects. It is not a part of the core Babylon.js library, so you will need to include the appropriate physics plugin in your project in order to use it.

For example, if you are using the Cannon.js physics engine, you will need to include the `babylon.cannon.js` file in your project, and create a `CannonJSPlugin` object to enable physics in your scene. Then, you will be able to use the `resetForces` method on the physics impostor objects associated with your mesh objects.

If you are using a different physics engine, such as Oimo.js or Ammo.js, you will need to include the appropriate plugin file and create the appropriate plugin object in order to use the `resetForces` method.

If you are not using a physics engine, or if you are using a version of Babylon.js that does not include the `resetForces` method, there is no built-in way to reset the impulse applied to a mesh. In that case, you can try using the `setLinearVelocity` and `setAngularVelocity` methods of the physics impostor to manually set the linear and angular velocity of the mesh to zero, which will effectively reset the impulse. For example:

```js
// Apply an impulse to the mesh
die6.physicsImpostor.applyImpulse(new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 10, 0), die6.getAbsolutePosition());

// Wait for some time
setTimeout(function () {
  // Set the linear and angular velocity of the mesh to zero
  die6.physicsImpostor.setLinearVelocity(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());
  die6.physicsImpostor.setAngularVelocity(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());
}, 1000);
```

In this example, the `applyImpulse` method is used to apply a vertical impulse to the die, which will make it start moving upwards. Then, the `setTimeout` function is used to wait for one second before calling the `setLinearVelocity` and `setAngularVelocity` methods on the die's physics impostor. These methods are used to set the linear and angular velocity of the die to zero, which will effectively reset the impulse and stop the die from moving.

Note that the `setLinearVelocity` and `setAngularVelocity` methods are part of the core Babylon.js library, so they are available even if you are not using a physics engine. However, they only affect the visual appearance of the mesh, and do not actually simulate physical forces, so the behavior of the mesh may not be realistic if you use these methods without a physics engine.

how do invert a vector3

## ChatGPT
To invert a `BABYLON.Vector3` object, you can use the `negate` method of the `BABYLON.Vector3` class. This method creates a new `BABYLON.Vector3` object that is the inverse of the original vector, with each component negated.

Here is an example of how you might use the `negate` method to invert a `BABYLON.Vector3` object:

```js
// Create a vector with the components (1, 2, 3)
var vector = new BABYLON.Vector3(1, 2, 3);

// Invert the vector
var invertedVector = vector.negate();

// The inverted vector has the components (-1, -2, -3)
```

In this example, the `vector` variable is created as a `BABYLON.Vector3` object with the components (1, 2, 3). The `negate` method is then called on this vector to invert it, and the resulting inverted vector is stored in the `invertedVector` variable. The `invertedVector` variable will have the components (-1, -2, -3).

Note that the `negate` method does not modify the original vector. It creates and returns a new `BABYLON.Vector3` object that is the inverse of the original vector. If you want to modify the original vector in place, you can use the `negateToRef` method instead, which negates the original vector and stores the result in the same vector. For example:

```js
// Create a vector with the components (1, 2, 3)
var vector = new BABYLON.Vector3(1, 2, 3);

// Invert the vector in place
vector.negateToRef(vector);

// The vector now has the components (-1, -2, -3)
```

In this example, the `vector` variable is created as a `BABYLON.Vector3` object with the components (1, 2, 3). The `negateToRef` method is then called on this vector, with the original vector as the parameter. This negates the original vector in place, so that the `vector` variable now has the components (-1, -2, -3).
